# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security concerns.

Use GitHub Security Advisories to report a vulnerability:
- Go to the repository page
- Click "Security" → "Advisories" → "Report a vulnerability"

Provide a clear description, reproduction steps, and impact assessment. We will acknowledge receipt and work with you on a fix and coordinated disclosure.

## Supported versions

Only the `main` branch is supported.
